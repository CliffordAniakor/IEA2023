# Worldwide Trends in CCUS Deployment and Adoption (So far)
- Clifford Okwudili Aniakor on 23rd September 2023
## Introduction
The dataset sourced from the IEA encapsulates CCUS projects and progression from around the world. The columns are self-explanatory. In this project, patterns and trends are revealed and accompanied by visualizations. The dataset required minimal to zero cleaning and questions were answered under the following statements:
- CCUS Deployment by Country
- Probable Fate of Captured CO2
- Number of Announced CCUS Projects Per Year
- Disaggregation of CCUS Projects by Sector and Project Type
- Progression of Average CCUS Capacity Over the Years
- CCUS Partner Companies by Participation
## Few Highlights
### Probable Fate of Captured CO2

### Conclusion
The following conclusions could be drawn:
- The United States is a global leader in CCUS projects while Carbon Solutions is the company with the most participation.
- 2022 saw a peak in both the number of CCUS projects and the average announced capacity while 2023 might discontinue the 5-year growth trend.
- From a sectorial standpoint, most announced projects are concentrated in the capture value chain with the exception of carbon management and natural gas processing sectors. Natural gas processing has more projects in the full value chain.
- Once captured, CO2 is more probable to be sequestered underground than utilized.
- Overall, most of the announced CCUS projects (more than 85%) are still in the planning phases while only 8-9% are currently operational.
